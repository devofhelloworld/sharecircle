## 💡 About The Project

Ever needed a drill for a single weekend project? Or a camping tent for just one trip? **ShareCircle** makes it easy to borrow items from people in your neighborhood instead of buying things you'll rarely use.

We believe in the power of shared resources. By connecting neighbors and fostering trust through verified profiles and community reviews, ShareCircle helps you:

- 💰 **Save Money** — Rent instead of buying items you need temporarily
- ♻️ **Reduce Waste** — Keep useful items in circulation rather than collecting dust
- 🏘️ **Build Community** — Strengthen bonds with your neighbors through mutual trust
